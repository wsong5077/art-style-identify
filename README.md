# Art Style Identification

This repository hosts the Art Style Identification project, which leverages the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, a state-of-the-art model primarily used in image recognition tasks. This project aims to fine-tune a pre-trained ViT model to identify and classify various art styles from images, making it a useful tool for art historians, curators, and enthusiasts alike.

## Project Overview

The Vision Transformer (ViT) model, originally designed for image classification tasks, is adapted here to the specific challenge of art style identification. By fine-tuning the model on a curated dataset of art images categorized by style, this project seeks to develop a robust tool for recognizing and analyzing artistic styles across diverse artworks.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip
- Access to a CUDA-capable GPU is recommended for training and inference phases.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wsong5077/art-style-identify.git
